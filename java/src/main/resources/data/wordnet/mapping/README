  The WN-Map tarball where this README was included 
  contains synset mappings between different WordNet 
  versions. There is one directory for each mapping:

   Directory	   Content
   -------------------------------------------
   mapping-15-16   mapping of WN1.5 to WN1.6
   mapping-16-17   mapping of WN1.6 to WN1.7
   mapping-16-171  mapping of WN1.6 to WN1.7.1
   mapping-16-20   mapping of WN1.6 to WN2.0
   mapping-17-20   mapping of WN1.7 to WN2.0
   mapping-171-20  mapping of WN1.7.1 to WN2.0

  In each directory, you'll find the files:

	wnXX-YY.adj    mapping for adjectives
	wnXX-YY.adv    mapping for adverbs
	wnXX-YY.noun   mapping for nouns
	wnXX-YY.verb   mapping for verbs

   where XX and YY are the digits for the mapped versions, without
   dots (e.g wn15-16, wn17-20, etc)

   The files contain a synset per line, and each line has 
   the following format:

	synset-XX (synset-YY weight)+ (m|p)

    That is, the first field is the synset in WN version XX, after, 
  there comes a non-empty list of pairs (synset YY, weight) 
  where all weights in the line add up to 1. If not, it means 
  that some of the discarded options had a low but non-zero weight.

    The last field indicates whether the WN XX synset was 
  "monosemous" (m) or "polysemous" (p), that is, if it had
  only one or many candidate synsets in WN YY to map to. 

  IMPORTANT:  Note that the mappings are automatically generated
  and unverified. Even more, they are not necessarily cross-consistent  
  (e.g. the mapping wn1.5-wn2.0 is not guaranteed to be the same
  than the result of concatenating the mapping wn1.5-wn1.6 with
  wn1.6-wn2.0)
